StudyShare cohorts consist of two types of people, Students and Subject Matter Experts(SMES).
The students of a given cohort will be in a closed group that doesn't change through the
length of the program. There will be one dedicated SME for each group that leads the Students
and keeps them on track.

When the students have completed the cohort they are then eligible to be an SME in that same
program. This self replicating model of SME & Students is a core component to making
study StudyShare grow.

Companies and brands can use StudyShare to build custom cohort models for things like Employee
& customer onboarding and trainings. Though cohort learning is proven to be a superior
method to individualized learning for many, the methods and frameworks weren't readily available
until now.
