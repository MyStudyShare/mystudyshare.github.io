It has been widely known that studying in a closed cohort not only increases subject
matter retention, but can also build lasting bonds between the individuals.

StudyShare was built with the idea that creating a cohort for anything should be easy.

By enabling anyone to create a cohort for anything we believe that unlock a greater
level of human potential within us all. As StudyShare grows an interlocking series of
deep connections will emerge to create the largest learning network on earth.

We're just getting started but we believe in the power of people to lift each other up
and at StudyShare we're tirelessly working to make that easier.
