Lambda School and other income share programs are increasing in popularity for their aligned incentive structure. These schools have
lowered the barrier of entry to the tech world for millions of people. For millions more however there is still the issue of cost of
living assistance while in the program.

We believe that if you invest in the right people for the right job you can start to change the momentum of the world. While ISA schools are creating the best way to learn a subject, you can help create the worlds best learning environment. By turning your extra room into a StudyShare, you'll be investing in the future of every student that stays with you.

We're currently looking for our first batch of hosts, if you're interested in learning more fill out our contact form.
